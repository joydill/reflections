1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Collaborating. 
    Keep another copy of files.
    Publish a project.
 
2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 
     Know when you are ready to pull new files, or willing to pull new files. 

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: clone a github repo to another github repo
    Clones: clone a local repo to another local repo, or clone a github (remote) repo to local repo, or clone a local repo to github (remote) repo.
    Branches: a label for a commit. 

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Dropbox. I cannot easily view who made what changes and reverse to certain versions. 

6. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Explore new ideas, or new versions without interfering the current working version.
